## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes):

1. **Dev server is running** at http://localhost:5175
   
2. **Create test data** in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- See: supabase/test_gamification_simple.sql
   -- Create tasks with coin rewards and assign to students
   ```

3. **Test as student**:
   - Login as a student
   - View tasks on dashboard
   - Click "Complete Task" button
   - See animated coin reward 🎉
   - Click 🏆 to view leaderboard
   - See your rank and coins

4. **Test leaderboard**:
   - Complete tasks with multiple students
   - View leaderboard to see rankings
   - Verify medals for top 3
   - Verify current user highlighting

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working (Ready to Demo):
- Database schema with gamification
- Coin earning and tracking
- Task completion flow
- Leaderboard display
- Student dashboard
- Beautiful UI with animations

### ⏸️ Pending (Future Work):
- Task CRUD (create/edit tasks with coin rewards)
- Teacher analytics dashboard

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test & Commit (Recommended)
1. Test the gamification flow
2. Stage and commit changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Create pull request
5. Merge to main

### Option 2: Add Task CRUD First
- Re-implement CreateTaskPage with coin_reward support
- Re-implement EditTaskPage with coin_reward support
- Takes 2-4 more hours
