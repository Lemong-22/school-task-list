# 🎮 Gamification System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Phase 3G: Leaderboard Page - COMPLETED

### What Was Built

#### 1. **LeaderboardPage Component** (`src/pages/LeaderboardPage.tsx`)
- Full-page leaderboard view showing all students ranked by coins
- Beautiful gradient background with modern UI
- Features:
  - **Top 50 students** displayed with medals for top 3 (🥇🥈🥉)
  - **Current user highlighting** - Your rank is highlighted with special styling
  - **Sticky rank display** - If you're ranked below #10, your rank appears at the top
  - **Back navigation** - Easy return to dashboard
  - **Loading states** - Smooth loading animation
  - **Error handling** - User-friendly error messages
  - **Empty state** - Helpful message when no rankings exist
  - **How to earn coins** - Educational footer section

#### 2. **Route Configuration** (`src/App.tsx`)
- Added `/leaderboard` route accessible to authenticated users
- Protected with `ProtectedRoute` component
- Accessible from the 🏆 button in StudentDashboard

#### 3. **Hook Integration**
- Uses `useLeaderboard(50)` to fetch top 50 students
- Uses `useStudentRank()` to get current user's rank
- Combines both hooks for complete leaderboard experience

### Testing the Leaderboard

#### Quick Test Flow:
1. **Login as a student** (e.g., student1@test.com)
2. **Complete a task** from your dashboard
3. **Click the 🏆 Leaderboard button** in the top-right corner
4. **View your rank** and coins earned
5. **See other students** on the leaderboard

#### Manual Testing with SQL:
Use the test scripts in `supabase/test_gamification_simple.sql` to:
- Create test tasks with coin rewards
- Assign tasks to students
- Complete tasks and award coins
- View the leaderboard
