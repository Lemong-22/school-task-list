## 🎮 Gamification Integration

All teacher CRUD operations are **fully compatible** with the gamification system:

### **Coin Rewards**

- ✅ Teachers can edit coin_reward for existing tasks
- ✅ Coin reward displayed on task cards with 🪙 badge
- ✅ Gamification tip explains: "Top 3 students get 3 bonus coins! Others get 1 coin. Late submissions get 0 coins."

### **Student Assignments**
- ✅ Tasks automatically create task_assignments for selected students
- ✅ Students see tasks in their dashboard
- ✅ Completing tasks triggers coin award logic
- ✅ Deleting tasks removes all assignments (cascade)

### **Database Compatibility**
- ✅ Uses `teacher_id` column (not deprecated `created_by`)
- ✅ Includes `coin_reward` column
- ✅ Includes `subject` column
- ✅ Compatible with all gamification migrations

VALUES (...);

INSERT INTO task_assignments (task_id, student_id, is_completed)
VALUES (...);
```

### **Update Task:**
```sql
UPDATE tasks 
SET title = ?, description = ?, subject = ?, due_date = ?, coin_reward = ?, updated_at = NOW()
