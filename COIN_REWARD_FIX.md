# Coin Reward System - Fixed! ✅

**Date:** 2025-11-01  
**Issue:** Students only getting 3 coins regardless of teacher's coin_reward setting  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### **Issue 1: Hardcoded Coin Values**
The `complete_task_and_award_coins` database function was ignoring the teacher's `coin_reward` value and hardcoding:
- 1 coin for regular completion
- 3 coins for top 3 students

**Example:** Teacher sets 1000 coins → Student only gets 3 coins ❌

### **Issue 2: Editable Coin Rewards**
Teachers could edit coin rewards after task creation, which could cause inconsistencies.

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **Fix 1: Use Teacher's Coin Reward Value**
**File:** `supabase/migrations/005_fix_coin_reward_logic.sql`

Updated the database function to:
- ✅ Use the teacher's `coin_reward` value from the tasks table
- ✅ **Top 3 students get DOUBLE coins** (2x the base amount)
- ✅ Other students get the base coin_reward amount
- ✅ Late submissions still get 0 coins

**New Logic:**
```
Teacher sets: 1000 coins
- Top 3 students: 2000 coins (DOUBLE!)
- Other students: 1000 coins (base amount)
- Late students: 0 coins
```

### **Fix 2: Make Coin Reward Immutable**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/EditTaskPage.tsx` - Coin reward field now disabled (read-only)
- `src/types/task.ts` - Removed `coin_reward` from `UpdateTaskInput`
- `src/pages/CreateTaskPage.tsx` - Updated gamification tip

**Changes:**
- ✅ Coin reward field is **disabled** in edit page
- ✅ Shows info: "Coin reward cannot be changed after task creation"
- ✅ Displays bonus calculation: "Top 3 get {amount * 2}, others get {amount}"
- ✅ Teachers can only set coin reward during task creation

## 🎮 New Gamification System

### **Coin Award Logic:**

1. **Late Submission (after due date):**
   - Coins awarded: **0**
   - Transaction type: `late_penalty`

2. **On-Time Submission (Top 3):**
   - Coins awarded: **coin_reward × 2** (DOUBLE!)
   - Transaction type: `bonus_reward`
   - Rank: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd

3. **On-Time Submission (Others):**
   - Coins awarded: **coin_reward** (base amount)
   - Transaction type: `base_reward`
   - Rank: 4th or later

### **Examples:**

**Task with 100 coin reward:**
- 1st student to complete: **200 coins** 🥇
- 2nd student to complete: **200 coins** 🥈
- 3rd student to complete: **200 coins** 🥉
- 4th student to complete: **100 coins**
- 5th student to complete: **100 coins**
- Late student: **0 coins** ⏰

**Task with 1000 coin reward:**
- Top 3 students: **2000 coins each** 🏆
- Other on-time students: **1000 coins each**
- Late students: **0 coins**
