For the MVP, we will use a clean, modern, and functional color palette with a dark theme.

- **Primary Background:** `#1A1A1A` (Dark Charcoal)
- **Content Background (Cards):** `#2A2A2A` (Slightly Lighter Grey)
- **Primary Accent:** `#3B82F6` (Blue-500) - For primary buttons, links, and highlights.
- **Primary Text:** `#F5F5F5` (Off-White)
- **Secondary Text:** `#A3A3A3` (Light Grey)
- **Font:** Use a system sans-serif font stack (Inter, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif).
- **Borders & Corners:** Use `rounded-lg` for all cards and buttons.

The ultimate goal in Phase 4 is to implement a more advanced "Glassmorphism" theme.

## CSS Best Practices

- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles
