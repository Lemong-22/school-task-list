## üéØ Core Business Logic

### Coin Award Rules

```
IF completed_at <= due_date THEN
  base_coins = 1
  
  IF student is in top 3 fastest THEN
    bonus_coins = 2
    total_coins = 3
  ELSE
    total_coins = 1
  END IF
ELSE
  total_coins = 0  (late penalty)
END IF
```

### Top 3 Determination

Students are ranked by `completed_at` timestamp (earliest first). Only students who complete tasks **on time** are eligible for bonus coins.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Summary

### New Table: `coin_transactions`
```sql
CREATE TABLE coin_transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id),
  coins_awarded INTEGER,
  transaction_type VARCHAR(50),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  UNIQUE(student_id, task_id)
);
```

### Modified Table: `profiles`
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN total_coins INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

### Modified Table: `task_assignments`
```sql
ALTER TABLE task_assignments 
ADD COLUMN is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

---

## üîß Key Technical Components

### Database Functions
1. **`complete_task_and_award_coins(p_task_assignment_id, p_student_id)`**
   - Core business logic
   - Handles task completion and coin calculation atomically
   - Returns JSON with coins awarded and new total

2. **`get_leaderboard(p_limit)`**
   - Returns top N students by total coins
   - Uses RANK() for ties
   - Optimized with indexes

### Frontend Hooks
1. **`useCoins`** - Handles task completion and coin operations
2. **`useLeaderboard`** - Fetches and manages leaderboard data
3. **`useTasks`** - Manages task list with completion status

### UI Components
1. **`CoinDisplay`** - Shows total coins in dashboard
2. **`CoinRewardModal`** - Feedback after earning coins
3. **`LeaderboardCard`** - Individual leaderboard entry
4. **`TaskCard`** - Task item with complete button
5. **`LeaderboardPage`** - Full leaderboard view

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The feature is complete when:

- ‚úÖ Students can complete tasks and earn coins
- ‚úÖ Bonus coins awarded correctly to top 3 students
- ‚úÖ Late submissions receive 0 coins
- ‚úÖ Total coins display on student dashboard
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard shows top 10 students
- ‚úÖ No duplicate coin awards possible
- ‚úÖ Performance < 1s for leaderboard queries
- ‚úÖ All UI components responsive and accessible
- ‚úÖ Zero critical bugs in production

---

## üìä Key Metrics to Track

Post-deployment, monitor:

- Task completion rate (before vs after gamification)
- Percentage of on-time vs late completions
- Distribution of bonus awards (how many students get top 3)
- Leaderboard engagement (page views, time spent)
- Student satisfaction scores
- System performance (query times, error rates)

---

## üîê Security Considerations

- All coin calculations happen **server-side** (in PostgreSQL functions)
- Students cannot manipulate coin values directly
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces data access rules
- Students can only complete their own assigned tasks
- Transaction history is immutable (no updates/deletes)
- UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate coin awards

---

## üé® UX Principles

1. **Immediate Feedback:** Show coin reward instantly after task completion
2. **Clear Communication:** Explain why students earned specific coin amounts
3. **Positive Reinforcement:** Even late completions are acknowledged positively
4. **Transparency:** Students can see their ranking and understand the system
5. **Accessibility:** All features work with keyboard and screen readers

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

This feature requires:

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1:** User Authentication (complete)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2:** Task Management CRUD (must be complete before starting)
- Existing tables: `profiles`, `tasks`, `task_assignments`
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling

---

## üîÑ Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

The following features are **NOT** included in Phase 3:

- Coin redemption/spending system
- Detailed transaction history view for students
- Weekly/monthly leaderboard variants
- Achievement badges or milestones
- Teacher ability to manually award/deduct coins
- Notification system for achievements
- Variable coin values per task difficulty
- Team-based competitions
- Coin penalties for other behaviors

These may be considered for Phase 4 or later iterations.
