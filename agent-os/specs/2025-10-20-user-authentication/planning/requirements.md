# User Authentication - Requirements Document

**Feature:** User Authentication
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 1. Overview

This document defines all functional and non-functional requirements for the User Authentication feature, which is the foundation (Phase 1) of the school task management application.

## 2. User Roles

The system supports two distinct user roles:
- **Student**: Can view assigned tasks and complete them
- **Teacher**: Can create, read, update, and delete tasks

## 3. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Registration
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Users must be able to create a new account with role selection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Registration form includes the following fields:
  - Full Name (text input, required)
  - Email (email input, required, must be valid email format)
  - Password (password input, required)
  - Confirm Password (password input, required, must match Password)
  - Role Selection (dropdown or radio button with "Student" and "Teacher" options, required)
- Password validation relies on Supabase's default security requirements
- Email must be unique (handled by Supabase Auth)
- Successful registration creates a user account in Supabase
- User role is stored in the user profile/metadata
- After successful registration, user is redirected to login page

### FR-2: User Login
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Registered users must be able to authenticate and access the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Login form includes the following fields:
  - Email (email input, required)
  - Password (password input, required)
- Successful login authenticates the user with Supabase Auth
- Invalid credentials show an appropriate error message
- After successful login, user is redirected based on their role:
  - Students → `/dashboard/student`
  - Teachers → `/dashboard/teacher`

### FR-3: Protected Routes
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Certain pages should only be accessible to authenticated users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard pages (both student and teacher) are protected
- If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected page, they are automatically redirected to `/login`
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes
- After login, users can only access pages appropriate to their role

### FR-4: User Logout
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Authenticated users must be able to log out of the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logout functionality is available on all authenticated pages
- Clicking logout clears the user session
- After logout, user is redirected to the login page
- Previously protected pages are no longer accessible until re-authentication

### FR-5: Role-Based Access Control
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Users should only access features appropriate to their role.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Student users can only access `/dashboard/student`
- Teacher users can only access `/dashboard/teacher`
- Role information is securely stored and verified
- Attempting to access a route for a different role redirects to the appropriate dashboard

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Security
- All passwords are securely handled by Supabase Auth (hashed, salted)
- Authentication tokens are securely managed
- No sensitive data is stored in local storage (only secure session tokens)
- HTTPS must be used in production

### NFR-2: Performance
- Login and registration should complete within 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Authentication state check should not cause noticeable UI delays

### NFR-3: Usability
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Form validation provides immediate feedback
- UI should be responsive and work on mobile devices

### NFR-4: Reliability
- Authentication system must leverage Supabase's built-in reliability
- Session persistence across browser refreshes
- Graceful error handling for network issues

## 5. Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
- **Authentication Provider:** Supabase Auth
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **State Management:** React Context API for auth state
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

### TR-2: Data Storage
- User credentials stored in Supabase Auth tables
- User role stored in user metadata or separate profiles table
- Session management handled by Supabase

### TR-3: Integration Points
- Supabase Auth API for all authentication operations
- React Context for global auth state management
- Protected Route component for route guarding

## 6. Out of Scope (for MVP)

The following are explicitly **NOT** included in this phase:
- Password reset/forgot password functionality
- Email verification
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication
- Remember me functionality
- Profile editing
- Account deletion
- Custom password strength requirements beyond Supabase defaults

## 7. Dependencies

- Supabase project must be set up and configured
- Supabase Auth must be enabled
- Environment variables configured for Supabase connection

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users can successfully register and log in
- Role-based redirection works correctly
- Protected routes are properly guarded
- No authentication-related errors in production
- Zero security vulnerabilities related to auth implementation
