2. **Teacher** - Can create, read, update, and delete tasks

### Registration Requirements
- Full Name (required)
- Email (required, valid format)
- Password (required, Supabase default validation)
- Confirm Password (required, must match)
- Role Selection (Student or Teacher)

### Login Requirements
- Email (required)
- Password (required)

### Post-Login Behavior
- **Students** ‚Üí `/dashboard/student`
- **Teachers** ‚Üí `/dashboard/teacher`

### Security Requirements
- Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login`

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Profiles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Row Level Security Policies
- Users can view their own profile
- Users can insert their own profile
- Users can update their own profile

## üìù Notes

### Scope Decisions
- **Included in MVP:**
  - Basic registration and login
  - Role-based access control
  - Protected routes
  - Session management

- **Excluded from MVP (Future Phases):**
  - Password reset functionality
  - Email verification
  - Social authentication
  - Two-factor authentication
  - Profile editing
  - Account deletion

### Design Considerations
- UI/UX will follow modern, clean design principles
- Mobile-responsive from the start
- Accessibility considered (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Error messages will be user-friendly and actionable

### Risk Mitigation
- Test Supabase connection early
- Implement route protection carefully to avoid security gaps
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow established coding standards
