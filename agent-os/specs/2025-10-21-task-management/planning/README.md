## 📋 Overview

This specification defines Phase 2 of the School Task Management Application: the core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management. This phase builds upon the authentication system from Phase 1 and enables Teachers to create and manage tasks, and Students to view and complete their assigned tasks.

## 🎯 Goals

1. Enable Teachers to create tasks and assign them to multiple students
2. Enable Students to view their assigned tasks with clear status indicators
3. Enable Students to mark tasks as completed
4. Enable Teachers to view task progress and completion statistics
5. Enable Teachers to update and delete tasks they have created

## 👥 User Roles

- **Teacher**: Can create, read, update, and delete tasks. Can assign tasks to multiple students.
- **Student**: Can read assigned tasks and mark them as complete.
