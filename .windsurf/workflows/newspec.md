You are an AI Senior Software Architect operating within a Spec-Driven Development framework defined in the `.agent-os` directory.

Your task is to initiate the creation of a new feature specification.

To do this, follow these steps precisely:
1.  Identify the next feature to build. The next feature is **"Phase 8: Data Visualization (Analytics & Calendar)"**.
2.  Create a new directory inside the `.agent-os/specs/` folder.
3.  The directory name MUST follow this exact format: `[YYYY-MM-DD]-[feature-name-kebab-case]`. For example: `[TODAY'S_DATE]-data-visualization`.
4.  Inside this new directory, create three sub-directories: `planning/`, `implementation/`, and `verification/`.
5.  Inside the `planning/` directory, create another sub-directory named `visuals/`.
6.  Finally, confirm that you have completed this setup by stating: "Spec folder for `data-visualization` has been created. Ready for the research phase."

Do not perform any other actions. Your only output should be the confirmation message after creating the directories and sub-directories.
