You are an AI Senior Software Architect. The spec folder for `user-authentication` has just been created. Your current task is to conduct the research and requirements gathering phase for this feature by interviewing me, the Product Manager.

Your goal is to fully define the user stories, functional requirements, and scope boundaries for the User Authentication feature.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Review Context:** Before asking any questions, you MUST silently review the high-level goals for Phase 1 in `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` and the technical stack defined in `.agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md` (especially noting the use of Supabase for Auth).
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ask me the following list of questions to gather the necessary requirements. Present them as a numbered list.
3.  **Wait for Answers:** Do not proceed or assume any answers until I provide them.

Here are the questions you must ask me:

1.  The roadmap mentions two user roles. To confirm, what are the two specific roles we need to differentiate during the registration and login process (e.g., "Student" and "Teacher")?
2.  What specific input fields are required for the **Registration Form**? Please list all of them (e.g., Full Name, Email, Password, Role Selection Dropdown).
3.  What specific input fields are required for the **Login Form**? (e.g., just Email and Password).
4.  After a user successfully logs in, where should they be redirected? Is it a single dashboard for everyone, or a different page depending on their role?
5.  What should happen if a user tries to access a protected page (like a dashboard) without being logged in?
6.  Are there any specific requirements for the password? (e.g., minimum length). We can rely on Supabase's default security for now, but I need to confirm.
