You are an AI Senior Software Architect. The spec folder for `coin-shop` has just been created. Your current task is to conduct the research phase by interviewing me, the Product Manager, to define the functional requirements for the new Coin Shop (Phase 4.2).

Your goal is to define what items we will sell, how the shop's database will work, and how users will equip (use) their purchased items.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Review Context:** Before asking any questions, you MUST silently review the high-level goals for Phase 4.2 and the existing `profiles` table (which has `total_coins`). You must also review the Phase 4.1 specs for the `ProfilePage`, which already has empty slots for "Titles" and "Badges".
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ask me the following list of questions to gather the necessary requirements. Present them as a numbered list.
3.  **Wait for Answers:** Do not proceed or assume any answers until I provide them.

Here are the questions you must ask me and give your own opinion:

1.  **Shop Items (MVP):** You had great ideas for items. To start, what specific cosmetic items should we sell in the MVP? (e.g., "Titles" and "Namecards"? "Badges"?). Please confirm.
2.  **Item Pricing:** How should we price these items? Should we use a simple, fixed price for each type (e.g., all Titles cost 50 coins), or should we have different prices based on rarity (e.g., Common Namecard = 50 coins, Rare Namecard = 500 coins)?
3.  **Database Design:** To build this, we'll need two new database tables.
    * (A) A `shop_items` table (to list all items for sale and their prices).
    * (B) A `user_inventory` table (to track which user owns which item).
    * Do you agree with this database approach?
4.  **"Equip" Logic:** After a user buys an item (like a "Title" or "Namecard"), how do they *use* or "equip" it? Should this be managed on their Profile Page (the page we just built in Phase 4.1)?
